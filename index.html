            When I go to the arcade with my <span id="pluralNoun1"></span> there are lots of games to play. I spend lots
            of time there with my friends. In the game X-Men you can be different <span id="pluralNoun2"></span>. The
            point of the game is to <span id="verb"></span> every robot. You also need to save people. Then you can go
            to the next level. In the game Star Wars you are Luke Skywalker and you try to destroy every <span
                id="noun"></span>. In a car racing/motorcycle racing game you need to beat every computerized vehicle
            that you are <span id="ingVerb"></span> against. There are a whole lot of other cool games. When you play
            some games you win <span id="pluralNoun3"></span> for certain scores. Once you're done you can cash in your
            tickets to get a big <span id="noun1"></span> You can save your <span id="pluralNoun4"></span> for another
            time. When I went to this arcade I didn't believe how much fun it would be. So far I have had a lot of fun
            every time I've been to this great arcade!
